            Hello and welcome to the first website i've ever made. My name is Rose,
            i'm 27, and it can only go up from here! I grew up in Birmingham, Al and 
            graduated from Pelham High School in 2010. After that I attended UAB, the 
            University of Alabama, for three years until I decided it wasn't meant 
            for me. Years pass and I end up moving to Orlando and I love it! 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Since being in Orlando I have grown a lot! I am currently a server at Luma
            on Park and I genuinely love my job. I'm also a photographer, I shoot with 
            a Sony A6300, and my favorite things to shoot are staged photoshoots or 
            concert photography! Speaking of concerts, I have seen my favorite band, 
            The 1975, 24 times and have traveled over 34,000 miles to see them.
